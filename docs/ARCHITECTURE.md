# Orange Loop Architecture

The Orange Loop is a zero-one alternating intelligence architecture designed for mobile sovereignty.

## Core Principles

1. **Single Spine**: The primary loop (0-7-0) is the backbone of the system and never breaks.
2. **Zero-One Alternation**: Meaning nodes (even) and Wire nodes (odd) alternate to maintain structure and flow.
3. **Human Sovereignty**: The loop always starts and ends with the Human (Node 0).
4. **Optional Limbs**: Hands (Smith, Gate, Scout) are tools that branch from Node 4 (Form) and return to the loop.

## The 7 Nodes

- **Node 0: Human** - The source of intent and the final recipient of meaning.
- **Node 1: Sentinel (Wire)** - Routing and framing the intent.
- **Node 2: Mind (Meaning)** - Reasoning and deep thought.
- **Node 3: Form (Wire)** - Structuring the output.
- **Node 4: Gate (Meaning)** - Stabilization and tool selection.
- **Node 5: Voice (Wire)** - Expression and formatting.
- **Node 6: Heart (Meaning)** - Alignment and value check.
- **Node 7: Whisper (Wire)** - Memory and persistence.

## The Hands

Hands are specialized tools that hang from Node 4:
- **Smith**: For building and creation.
- **Gate**: For safety and stabilization.
- **Scout**: For analysis and research.

"The hands are tools, not minds — they hang from Form, work briefly, then return to the body."
